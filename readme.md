#Draggy
draggy.js is a small JavaScript library for creating draggable elements.
It has been especially designed for JavaScript applications (sinle-page apps) where DOM elements might be removed but state should be preserved.

draggy.js has no dependencies, but require browsers to support CSS3 transform (translate).
